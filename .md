## IdeaBox

We're going to be following a project created by JumpStart Lab that will help you understand the process of building a web application.

> Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." Let’s build a system to record your good, bad, and awful ideas.

> And let’s use it as an excuse to learn about Sinatra.

## Before We Start

You're viewing this project on Github, a social network for developers from all over the world.

Here they are able to share code with each other and collaborate on ways to improve projects
of all languages and function.

We're going to use Github to collaborate on building the IdeaBox project and following through the guide.

Github has a lot of videos on YouTube to help you understand both their website and Git itself. The video below is an introduction to some of the people at Github and the advantages of Git.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign up for Github

First you'll need to sign up for [**Github**](github.com/signup) which is **free** for **open source**^ projects.

[_Read more here_](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)

### 2. Create Your Own "Fork"

Github has fantastic documentation about how to use the network and how to use the underlying tool of Git.

To get started you're going to want to create your own copy of this project, doing that is called **"forking"** a project.

### 3. Sign up for Cloud9 IDE

Similar to Treehouse here you will be able to create your own virtual workspaces. [Cloud9](https://c9.io) IDE is a bit more clever in that it can read and write to your GitHub profile. It also has a terminal for controlling Git and Ruby.

**Alernatively you can develop on your own machine**. For instructions on setting this up [_read more here_](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

### 4. Start Working Through the Excercise

As mentioned above we're building an Idea Box, you'll be able to go through those instructions to complete the first section.

> However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source,
